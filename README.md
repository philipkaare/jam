An interpreter for jam - a beginner's programming language

See https://medium.com/computer-programming-and-so-can-you/an-interpreter-for-p-code-and-videos-f920f7e6377a for a description of my design goals. It's a year old, but I have recently begun to make some progress on the interpreter and since I now have the basic infrastructure, I actually think it's realistic to finish. 

You can look at the issues to see what's missing and of course I would love to see a pull request :)
